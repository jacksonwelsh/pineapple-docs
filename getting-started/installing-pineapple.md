# Installing Pineapple

Pineapple is crucial for any business operations at our company. To get started, connect to the corporate VPN and connect to our main server. Enter the following commands:

```bash
cp -r ~admin/pineapple/
cd pineapple
./configure
make && make install
```

In doing this, you'll install `pineapple-cli` for your local user.

In our next chapter, we'll talk about using `pineapple-cli` to do some of our regular business operations.
